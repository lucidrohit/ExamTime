# Exam Time -Hobbie project for my college

As we know , Most of the engineering students start preparing one day before the exam or
in extreme cases on the day of exam. 

But this is now difficult to do for online exams, because most of the student don't attend the classes and therefore they have no notes
and as a fresher, i know how difficult it is to ask/talk any new classmate/CR's to send notes of whole bulky notebook.

So to make it easy, I got any idea to solve this problem.

With ExamTime Admin/Cr can add link of Syllabus, Notes, Pyq's, Books, ClassLinks for particular semester / mid semester and student can access these all material at one place and no need to ask again and again to cr's.
